Overview
--------

This Perl module provides bindings for `Broccoli
<http://www.icir.org/christian/broccoli/index.html>`_, Bro's client
communication library. In general, the bindings provide the same
functionality as Broccoli's C API.

Installation
------------

I'm not really comfortable with cmake yet, but ideally all you would
need to do is the following after Broccoli itself has been installed:

    > ./configure
    > ( cd build && make install )

For now there are some obstacles:
- you need the cmake/ folder from git://git.bro-ids.org/cmake
- you should add cmake/FindPerlBroccoli.cmake from this repository
- install might fail because it does not find broccoli_intern.pm.
  In this case copy it from ./build to ./


Usage
-----

See examples in the tests/ folder
